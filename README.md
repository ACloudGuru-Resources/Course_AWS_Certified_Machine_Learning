# COURSE_AWS_CERTIFIED_MACHINE_LEARNING
An A Cloud Guru Course - 
[AWS Certified Machine Learning](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty)

Your executive board members are asking you to do something with it. Your grandmother is asking you if it will put you out of a job. Your deadbeat college roommate is asking if you can help him find a date with it. Everyone seems to fuss over Machine Learning, but how many of us truly understand it? Too few.

Fortunately, ACG has your back yet again with a fresh course focused on helping you outsmart the new AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty. In typical ACG manner, we have created a course that confronts the potentially dull and boring topic of machine learning head-on with quirky and engaging lectures, interactive labs and plenty of real-world, plain-speak examples.
